This project outlines the development of a simple quiz app using the Flutter framework with Firebase 

integration. The app will consist of multiple screens, including a loading page, quiz pages, correct/wrong 

answer feedback pages, and a final score page. Firebase Realtime Database will be used to store and 

retrieve quiz data.
